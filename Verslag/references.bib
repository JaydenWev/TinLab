 abstract = {In this renowned volume, Hermann Weyl discusses the symmetric, full linear, orthogonal, and symplectic groups and determines their different invariants and representations. Using basic concepts from algebra, he examines the various properties of the groups. Analysis and topology are used wherever appropriate. The book also covers topics such as matrix algebras, semigroups, commutators, and spinors, which are of great importance in understanding the group-theoretic structure of quantum mechanics.Hermann Weyl was among the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century. He made fundamental contributions to most branches of mathematics, but he is best remembered as one of the major developers of group theory, a powerful formal method for analyzing abstract and physical systems in which symmetry is present. InThe Classical Groups, his most important book, Weyl provided a detailed introduction to the development of group theory, and he did it in a way that motivated and entertained his readers. Departing from most theoretical mathematics books of the time, he introduced historical events and people as well as theorems and proofs. One learned not only about the theory of invariants but also when and where they were originated, and by whom. He once said of his writing, "My work always tried to unite the truth with the beautiful, but when I had to choose one or the other, I usually chose the beautiful."Weyl believed in the overall unity of mathematics and that it should be integrated into other fields. He had serious interest in modern physics, especially quantum mechanics, a field to whichThe Classical Groupshas proved important, as it has to quantum chemistry and other fields. Among the five books Weyl published with Princeton,Algebraic Theory of Numbersinaugurated theAnnals of Mathematics Studiesbook series, a crucial and enduring foundation of Princeton's mathematics list and the most distinguished book series in mathematics.},

abstract="Invariant theory is the great romantic story of mathematics. For one hundred and fifty years, from its beginnings with Boole to the time, around the middle of this century, when it branched off into several independent disciplines, mathematicians of all countries were brought together by their common faith in invariants: in England, Cayley, MacMahon, Sylvester and Salmon, and later, Alfred Young, Aitken, Littlewood and Turnbull. In Germany, Clebsch, Gordan, Grassmann, Sophus Lie, Study; in France, Hermite, Jordan and Laguerre; in Italy, Capelli, d'Ovidio, Brioschi, Trudi and Corrado Segre; in America, Glenn, Dickson, Carus (of the Carus Monographs), Eric Temple Bell and later Hermann Weyl. Seldom in history has an international community of scholars felt so united by a common scientific ideal for so long a stretch of time. In our century, Lie theory and algebraic geometry, differential algebra and algebraic combinatorics are offsprings of invariant theory. No other mathematical theory, with the exception of the theory of functions of a complex variable, has had as deep and lasting an influence on the development of mathematics.",
